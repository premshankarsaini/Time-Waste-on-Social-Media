# Time-Waste-on-Social-Media
This is Python Projects on "Time Waste on Social-Media" by People........

Key Components of the Project:

Data Collection and Preparation:

The project begins by collecting data on users' social media usage. This data likely includes information on:

Time spent on various social media platforms.
Self-control measures, such as users' ability to resist checking notifications or engaging in prolonged browsing sessions.
Demographics like age and gender to allow for comparative analysis.
The data is cleaned and preprocessed for analysis, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Initial exploration of the dataset is performed to understand basic patterns and trends.
Key EDA steps include:

Summarizing the data to provide an overview of central tendencies (mean, median) and distributions (e.g., hours spent on social media).
Visualizing correlations between variables like gender, age, and self-control levels, to uncover relationships.

Data Visualization:-

The project makes extensive use of visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful charts and graphs. These visualizations include:-

Line plots to show trends in self-control across different demographics.
Bar charts or histograms to represent time spent on social media, comparing groups like males vs. females or younger vs. older users.
Insights are derived from these charts, such as the fact that females tend to have higher self-control than males, or that younger users waste more time on social media.
